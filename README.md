# A deep learning approach for the quantification of molecular organization from single-molecule localization microscopy

## Abstract

Recent developments in super-resolution microscopy techniques have provided the necessary tools to observe single molecules in living cells. However, these techniques require improved methods for the quantitative analysis of the images.  The booming of deep learning offers a wide palette of approaches for image analysis that might be exploited for this task.
In this thesis, we developed a methods for the analysis of super-resolution images of exocytic sites. Exocytosis is a biological process necessary to release waste and other molecules in cells, and involves the targeted transportation and the fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane.  We focused on the imaging of the exocyst complex, which mediates in the fusion of vesicles with the membrane of the cells. We developed a tool capable of counting the number of exocysts and determine the underlying structure on which exocysts could be located starting from super-resolution images. The approach relies on deep learning techniques to analyze and classify the images in different categories. To build this structure we take advantage of a widely use architecture, called U-Net, to generate two extra images from the microscopy image and then use the three of them to extract further information through two extra branches of the network, providing the number of exocysts present in the initial image and the structure of these exocysts. This composite structure provide a powerful method to extract relevant biological information from exocytosis imaging and provide the researchers with a new tool to further develop their studies.
